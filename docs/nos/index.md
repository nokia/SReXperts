# Network Operating Systems (NOS)

This section contains the activities for the NOS stream of the 2025 SReXperts hackathon.

Network Operating Systems (NOS) sit right at the heart of the Internet and operate the critical infrastructure of both countries and organizations.  They provide a very specialized software system capable of making split second decisions to ensure network traffic is directed to the right location, at the right time, with the right priority and without compromise.

Network Operating Systems run on the most advanced routing and switching systems in the world.

As time has progressed, Network Operating System's have evolved and the need for automation and programmability has been at the forefront of this evolution.  NOS' have developed from systems that are operated by a small set of very skilled engineers using a CLI, to systems with rudimentary automation capabilities using CLI screen scraping, to the first structured data interfaces (SNMP) and into the modern model-driven Network Operating Systems we see today.  

These modern operating systems are designed and built with automation in mind, defined and modeled in YANG for clear structured definition of all aspects of the system and ensuring consistency of data regardless of how they are being used.  They have progressed further to expose these consistent data models over equally consistent, standardized interfaces for machine-to-machine communication allowing for smooth integration into the biggest automated networks in the world.

Of course, progress doesn't stop, and Network Operating Systems need to evolve further to include programmability solutions both on the device for rapid, human-free operational activities, and remotely to open the network management ecosystem up for operators.

Nokia has two modern, model-driven, programmable Network Operating Systems in the IP portfolio: [SR OS](https://www.nokia.com/ip-networks/service-router-operating-system-nos/) focused on the core infrastructure of network operators, and [SR Linux](https://www.nokia.com/ip-networks/service-router-linux-NOS/) focused on the data-center.

In this hackathon you have the opportunity to undertake challenges on both Network Operating Systems with a focus on model-driven automation and programmability.

## Tackling the activities

A number of activities have been created for you to follow, separated by our rough estimation of difficulty level (opinions may vary :smile:).  Feel free to attempt any of them, or work any project you have in mind.  Which ever approach you choose, a team of dedicated experienced Nokia engineers is on hand to assist you.

### Split by Network Operating System (NOS): SR OS and SR Linux

For organizational purposes, we have separated those activities focusing on SR OS from those focusing on SR Linux.  That doesn't mean that you need to pick one NOS and stick with it.  The hackathon is a great opportunity to both expand your knowledge on familiar NOS' and to get exposure on unfamiliar ones.

### Standalone activities and not in order

Each activity is a stand alone use-case.  Each has a scenario, a set of objectives and lots of information for you to learn and practice.  

**The activities are not in order**.  You do not need to start at the top and work your way down.  We recommend instead that you take a look through activities that sound interesting and tackle the ones that you feel would give you the most benefit, whether that's solidifying knoweldge you already have or learning a totally new technology.

### You can't break anything

OK, famous last words we know but, each group's network is totally self-contained.  No changes you make will effect any other group's activities and no-one will get upset if you break everything, so dive right in and don't be afraid to try it and see.

### Help us make the hackathon the best it can be

Each year we review the feedback and lessons learned from the previous years hackathon as we want to continually deliver the best, and most useful, experience we can.  To help us do this we have two asks:

- You will notice, next to each task there is a blue `Start` button.  When you start to attempt each task, would you please click the button.
- When you complete an activity (or even if you don't manage to complete it), you will find a very short questionairre at the end.  Would you please fill it out as honestly as you feel able to, we won't be offended if you think something was awful, and equally we like praise as much as the next person!

These two small asks will help us continue to improve your experience for when you return next year!

## Gaining access to the network

Each group has their own complete network, including an IP core running segment routing, multiple data-centers, a braodband network and client and subscriber devices.  This is your playground.  It is all pre-configured and operating as a real end-to-end network would.  

The NOS stream activities focus on the SR OS and SR Linux devices in the network, but many of them also use the Linux client and subscriber devices as well.

To gain access to any of the devices you can either connect using SSH to your groups hackathon server (also references as hackathon VM in a number of the activities) or use the ports mapped directly to the node and service you want to connect to from your own laptop.  More details are available on the [main page of this hackathon site](../index.md).

**Refer to your handout for the username and passwords of any of the equipment in your network.**

## Help!

If you need help at anytime you have a few options:


- Take a look at the reference material and hints provided in the activities.
- Ask other members of your group, or other groups for help.  Collaboration is one of the best elements of the hackathon.
- Put your hand up or otherwise grab the attention of one of the team to assist you (that is what they are there for so please use them!)

## Ask us (almost) anything

Not only are the team here to help you with anything in the hackathon, but they also have a wide range of knowledge about Nokia, our products, our services and our technologies.  Please ask anything that's on your mind.

We'd also love to hear from you about what you're doing with automation and programmability in your network and any of the amazing or more challenging things you are working on.
