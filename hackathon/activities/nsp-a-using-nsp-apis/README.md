2. Enter on environment variables to confirm the NSP instance. Moreover, each participant will have a different target NeId, configure it accordingly.
3. Execute the desired requests to perform statistics collection on NSP objects.

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have Postman installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
- Import the collection JSON file provided into Postman (`Network Programming via NSP APIs - SReXpert EMEA 2024.postman_collection.json`).
- Import the environment file provided (`Hackhathon SReXperts EMEA 2024.postman_environment.json`) into Postman.

### Steps:

0. Discovery of the lab

If this is your first NSP activity for this hackathon, ensure to first execute the activity called `nsp-b-lab-discovery`. It should not take long!

1. **Initial Authentication - Get Token**
   - Open Postman.
   - Ensure that the environment variables `server`, `user`, and `password` are imported from the environment file and correctly set.
   - Run the "Initial Authentication - Get Token" request.
   - Verify that the request executes successfully and retrieves the access token. The token will be automatically stored as a global variable for subsequent requests.

2. **Get Ports from Specific neId**
   - Ensure the access token obtained in step 1 is available as a global variable.
   - Set the environment variable `neId` with the specific Network Element ID.
   - Run the "Get ports from specific neId" request.
   - Check the response to verify that it retrieves the ports associated with the specified Network Element ID. The ports with the format "1/1/cX/Y" will be counted and printed.

3. **Create Subscription Ports in neId**
   - Ensure the access token obtained in step 1 is available as a global variable.
   - Set the environment variable `neId` with the specific Network Element ID.
   - Run the "Create subscription ports in neId" request. [NSP Telemetry API Documentation 24.4 - Restconf Subscription](https://network.developer.nokia.com/learn/24_4/network-operations/network-and-service-assurance/telemetry/model-driven-mediation-mdm-telemetry/mdm-telemetry-use/#Use_Case_1%C2%A0RESTCONF_Subscription_Management%C2%A0) explains the meaning of variables and how they can be used. For the current subscription main parameters are:

	- **name**:
        - The "name" of a subscription must be unique and cannot be modified during the lifetime of the subscription. It typically describes the purpose or function of the subscription.
        - Example: `"Port-Utilization-{{neId}}"`

    - **type**:
        - The value for "type" must be defined as the "classId" in the MDM Telemetry Device Mapping files. It specifies the type of telemetry data being collected.
        - Example: `"telemetry:/base/interfaces/utilization"`

    - **notification**:
        - The "notification" parameter must be set to "enabled" for the Kafka notification service. It enables the notification mechanism for the subscription.
        - Example: `"enabled"`

    - **db**:
        - Use the "db" parameter to enable DB persistence for data collection. It is required for Use Case 5: Historical and Real-time Data Subscription, Streaming, and Plotting when historical data subscription is desired.
        - Example: `"enabled"`

    - **sync-time**:
        - The "sync-time" parameter specifies the collection interval anchor. It controls when a subscription is started and is used to stagger multiple subscriptions for improved performance.
        - Example: `"00:00"`

    - **filter**:
    	- The "filter" parameter enhances filtering functionality using xpath expressions to identify objects. They can be obtained from the inventory model.
    	- Example: `"/nsp-equipment:network/network-element[ne-id='{{neId}}']/hardware-component/port"`

4. **Delete RESTCONF Subscriptions**
   - Ensure the access token obtained in step 1 is available as a global variable.
   - Run the "Delete RESTCONF subscriptions" request.
   - Confirm that the request successfully deletes the specified RESTCONF subscription via NSP UI.

**Note:** Ensure that the environment file (`Hackhathon SReXperts EMEA 2024.postman_environment.json`) is imported and correctly configured with the required variables (`server`, `user`, `password`, `neId`) before executing each request.
