# Solution for Extending Roles to support static routes

The [`intent-based-ansible-lab`](https://github.com/srl-labs/intent-based-ansible-lab) has a branch `feat-static-routes` that extends the roles to support static routes. 

You can either see the diff between the `main` and `feat-static-routes` branches:

```bash
git diff origin/feat-static-routes -- playbooks/roles
```

and/or switch to the `feat-static-routes` branch with:

```bash
git fetch && git switch feat-static-routes
```

to see a solution to support static routes.
